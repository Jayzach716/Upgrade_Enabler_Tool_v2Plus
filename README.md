## Create Modified Windows ISO or install.wim(esd) To Be Able To Directly Upgrade From any Windows Build


Put the source ISO inside the "Source_ISO" folder and run "RunME.cmd".

To modify the install.wim(esd) adjust ModifyESD.cmd with drive letter that contains sources folder and launch the script.

Now you can use the fixed ISO to upgrade by mounting the ISO and running setup.exe.
